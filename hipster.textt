e source control software you use is the heart of your software development process. It is arguably the most important mission-critical software in your development organization. It is crucial that it fully supports your development practices and policies, and that it provides all the features you need to properly manage your development activity.

Version control systems and software configuration management (SCM) systems are not the same thing. SCM systems provide a great deal more than simple version control. They provide the tools and features you need to manage your source code in today's dynamic, fast-paced development environments using processes like Agile, Scrum, and CMMI. Products like CVS and Subversion are file-oriented version control systems that simply lack the capability to support modern software development. They are cumbersome, difficult to maintain, and don't have the features that are essential for managing your development projects like enterprise-wide change tracking and project level differencing and merging. Products such as GitHub that are built using these file-oriented systems inherit those same deficiencies. If you have been using one of these products and have been trying to make it work in an active environment then you know how limited they are.

Reasons to Choose Source Reliance
Version control, also known as source control, is the practice of tracking and managing changes to software code. Version control systems are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time. As development environments have accelerated, version control systems help software teams work faster and smarter. They are especially useful for DevOps teams since they help them to reduce development time and in.
